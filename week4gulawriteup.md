# Week 4

## Gula's Game of the Week - GNS(2-1) vs KGuns Team(1-2)
- Week 4 brings about one of LPBs longest and most tantalizing rivalries.  On paper there may be more exciting matchups this week, but with bragging rights at stake this matchup deserves to be considered the main event.
    - **GNS** is free off an ass-whipping of Team20Five, seeing herculean efforts from this Chargers duo single handedly outscore the opposition.  *WR Allen* was in top form collecting over 200 yards for the rare double bonus.  If Dustin had his choice he might have saved this explosive performance for the matchup with Jake for added shit-talking rights but there is a decent chance he may see more big output with this weeks matchups.
    - **KGuns** relied on a balanced attack last week to top Glab 'em by the time the dust settled on Monday Night.  Jake has his own potent duo who has yet to really percolate this season.  Being 1-2 without *QB Burrow* and *WR Chase* really go off has to be somewhat reassuring.
- Potential wrinkle here if *RB Mixon* ends up finishing off scoring drive for the Bengals offense that could determine the outcome of this tight matchup.

### A-Aron's Team (3-0) vs Labbatt Drew Light(1-1)
- The two newest LPB owners lock horns in this much anticipated tilt.  Yahoo predictions suggest this could be a down to the wire game.
    - **A-Aron's Team** has made an immediate impact on LPB (some are likening his arrival to Deion Sanders at Colorado) as he has yet to take an L this campaign.  Fans of analytics though point to his soft schedule, low scoring output and reliance on aging QBs to lead his team as reasons why this romance may not last.
    - **Labbatt Drew Light** will need to rely on *QB Mahomes* having a solid performance if he expects his team to be the first to take the opposition to pound town.  Will the star quarterback revel in the spectacle that has surrounded the Chiefs star tight end, or will the Sunday Sauce be too spicy against a potentially stingy Jets D?
  
### Disease(2-1) vs Team20Five(1-2)
- A battle of former Kindred Kindergartners features in week 4 LPB.
    - **Team 20Five** quite simply is in shambles.  Questions are already swirling around draft strategy and roster management as the scoring output has been simply enemic through 3 weeks of competition.  Last Thursday's dreadful *QB Jones* and *TE Waller* showing basically sealed his fate before the game had even begun.  He can only hope that singing *WR Collins* can counter Falls' shrewd *QB Stroud* acquisition and that he sees increased output from his position players to get back to .500 and stave off further questions.
    - **Disease** was able to convert a well rounded performance from his team into a very comfortable and convincing win in week 3.  With no obvious weaknesses save for maybe the TE position he seems well suited to being near the top of the LPB standings.  Pundits wonder if he is playing with fire though using the Bills D against the high octange Dolphins offense in week 4.

### CF(2-1) vs Poopsnake(1-2)
- Two teams who find themselves at the bottom look up of LPB align for this matchup which according to projections could be one to watch.
    - **Poopsnake** is wondering if the franchise name change has had a positive or negative effect on team morale.  Marketing and Jersey sales are surely back up, but the teams on field performance simply hasn't been enough during the last couple of weeks during the Glab 'Em period.  He does likely get *RB Jones* back and might have some good matchups on the calender particularly for the Raiders who could possibly pile up points against a vulnerable Chargers D.
    - **CF** will once again roll out the thrilling *QB Allen* and *QB Hurts* duo to lead the charge in this contest.  It's still hard to see any weakness in this strategy as long as both are healthy, and this week has the added bonus of mental warfare against Mike as he may shid and fard if and when *QB Allen* in particular goes off.

### Dead Rabbits(0-3) vs Colt(2-1)
- Last but not least the potentially most lobsided game on the LPB schedule features the juggernaught Colt versus a Dead Rabbits team that is struggling to find answers.
    - **Colt** is looking like a genius after his week 3 performance went nuclear primarily based on his Dolphins leaving the Sean Payton Broncos defense with radioactive feces in their pants.  If *QB Tua* remains healthy it's hard to see him having down weeks although this week he might be a bit conflicted both personally and professionally as the Dolphins come to his very own office.  Maybe this inner conflict is enough to give Pat some light and the end of the tunnel in week 4.
    - For **Dead Rabbits** the situation is dire, but there may still be hope that he can right the ship.  Starting off with an 0-3 record may prove a hill too steep to climb but there are those around the league that think with the players featured on his roster there is still a chance.  Pat will need veteran leadership to rule the day with scoring from all parts of his roster, or potentially just a solid performance from the Bills defense to keep Miami's high octane offense in check.
