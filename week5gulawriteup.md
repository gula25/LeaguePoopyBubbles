# Week 5

## Gula's Game of the Week - GNS(3-1) vs cF(3-1)
- A house divided.  What more can be said about the 1st vs 2nd place matchups featuring the brothers Arnold?  Certainly more than sole possesion of 1st place in LPB is at stake when these two toe the line this week.
    - **GNS** sits comfortably in 2nd place right behind his bro, after cruising to a win-by-default in last weeks GotW which turned into a dud.  Consistent scoring output and favorable matchups may have Dustin thinking ahead to post season play as he continues to try to fine tune his roster.  He will certainly need to pull all the right strings against a dangerous cF squad this week.
    - **cF** the early results are in and so far the double-barrell shotgun draft strategy of *QB Allen* and *QB Hurts* has looked genius.  Chad relied on getting nearly half of his scoring output from his two bell cows in last weeks showdown with the commish.  *QB Allen* lead all scorers to Mike's both delight and dismay with over 47.  When both QBs go off Chad will be tough to beat on any given week even with just token contributions from elsewhere on his roster.
- Word on the street is that whoever wins this weeks matchup in LPB will be considered the favored son in the Arnold family dynasty and considered heir to the throne for all Arnold family rights, properties and rights.

### A-Aron's Team (3-1) vs Poopsnake(1-3)
- Old friendship serves as the backdrop for this renewed rivalry as two teams with seemingly opposite early season fortunes collide.
    - **A-Aron's Team** finally relented in week 4 with a loss at the hands of Drew.  All told, he was playing with house money after a very favorable early slate of matchups kept the momentum going for him early on.  No one likes to put up a sub 80 scoreline which can be considered an almost surefire recipe for defeat in LPB.  Now A-A-Rons resiliency and gumption will be put to the test for the first time as we enter the meat of the LPB calender.
    - **Poopsnake** has shown genuine signs of concern in the LPB group text as he comes to the realization that his roster of underperformers has so far painted him into a corner.  On paper the projections don't look great in Week 5, but if the potentially explosive Jags or Eagles on his roster show out he may be able to stave off the carrion eaters for another week.
  
### Colt(2-2) vs Team20Five(2-2)
- This game features two owners who in hindsight may have had one of the most dubious and senseless LPB Auction confrontations in league history over *QB Pickett*.
    - **Team 20Five** has so far managed to yo-yo his way to a .500 performance following up fards with shids on a consistent basis.  His roster has been bolstered with FA acquisition WRs, including a master stroke with the *WR Collins* signing last week as he was the player of the game in his week 4 win over Disease.  It may just be a matter of getting the points to show up on the field and not the bench this year, assuming they come at all, which is no gaurentee and easier said then done.
    - **Colt** has also seemingly opted to fard then shid throughout his early campaign.  Big weeks followed by duds is not a recipe for a top seed in LPB, but we all know Colt has made a habit out of making late season surges to titles.  His 3 headed beast was kept in check in Buffalo, which helped his reality but ruined his fantasy in week 4.  This week a favorable matchup against the Giants could make the difference as he looks to outlast his fellow Cadet/Blue Devil alum.

### Disease(2-2) vs KGuns(1-3)
- Tennis anyone?  Two longtime friends look to move the rivalry off of the hard cart (away from Mr Brock) and into a juicy Week 5 LPB tilt.
    - **Disease** Simply wasn't on his best behavior last week and ran into a wood chipper Team20Five performance that was a *QB Fields* start away from almost putting a bicentennial up on him.  Fortunately he still sits comfortable in 4th place and is probably feeling good about holding serve against Jake with some favorable matchups featured on his squad.
    - **KGuns** will need to rally after a demoralizing performance against his LPB arch nemesis Dustin last week.  His entire squad was unstrung outside of a solid *WR Aiyuk* showing.  He is a decided underdog in this matchup according to projections, but anyone who knows Jake knows his capability to Serve and Volley his way back.  Could this be the week that his Bengals duo wakes up from its slumber?

### Dead Rabbits(1-3) vs Labbatt Drew Light(2-2)
- Some are calling this matchup the battle of the thousand beers.  Fireworks could set off in this sleeper pick for LPB game of the week, as both teams feature well rounded rosters with a high go-off quotient.
    - **LDL** added a notch to his belt after securing A-A-Ron's virginity in week 4.  *WR Diggs* lead his scoring with a massive multi touchdown game while he found solid contributions from thje rest of his team.  This game against the Rabbits is considered a trap game by many in vegas as he projects to win comfortably yet many sharp bettors see the spread in favor of his opponent.  If he finally gets an explosive *QB Mahomes* performance you'd think he stands to do well once again.
    - For **Dead Rabbits** things are looking up after securing his first win on the season after an impressive Colt ass beat.  Three great RB performances led by a super-saiyan job by *RB McCaffrey* meant this game was never really in question at all.  Truth be told, just the RBs alone outscored Colts entire squad, and that has to be cause for optimism heading into Week 5 as Pat looks to climb back into the standings.
