# Week 3

## Gula's Game of the Week - CF(2-0) vs A-Aron's Team(2-0)
- Two undefeateds clash in this 1 vs 2 matchup and based on projections it figures to be a tight showdown.
    - **A-A-Ron's Team** is sitting pretty after riding a trademark good version of Jekyll/Hyde *QB Cousins*.  The game against **KGUNS** was never in doubt, welcoming back *TE Kelce* into the fold and getting solid production from his veterans.  He may be riding high now, but the rest of the league is wondering how long the smoke and mirrors routine keeps up as he relies on *QB Cousins* and *QB Stafford*.
    - **CF** has it rolling with his two pronged attack of *QB Hurts* and *QB Allen* paying off dividends so far this year.  He won last weeks GGotW by leading from wire to wire against Drew.  *WR Samuel* is bouying his recieving corp while *TE Hockenson* has proven to have go off potential in his own right.
- Winner of this game will surely be in the driver's seat heading into the thick of things in LPB.  At the same time below the surface both of these teams may be in a more precarious position than it appears at first glance.  Time will tell!

### Colt(1-1) vs Labbatt Drew Light(1-1)
- A battle of old Fredonia dormitory comrades injects some intrigue into week 3 of LPB.
    - **Colt** might be still trying to figure out which was is up after his team showed near fatal symptoms against **Disease** in week 2.  His team followed up an amazing week 1 performance with a flaccid one in week 2.  One has to wonder what Colt himself thinks of his team, especially with the state of his big play combo with *WR Hill* and *WR St-Brown* on the injury report.  He's hoping for the best this week but this could be a classic fantasy nightmare fuel situation in the making. 
    - **Labbatt Drew Light** has not been shy in the league text looking for anyway to improve his team around the edges.  A tough loss even with a solid *QB Mahomes* game in his week 2 outing has him thinking there is more work to be done.  You have to think if he has another solid output turned in by *QB Love* and *WR Smith* among others that could be enough to stay above .500 heading into week 4.
  
### GNS(1-1) vs Team20Five(1-1)
- Two 3x LPB Champions go head to head in this matchup in a bid for East-Side dominance in LPB.
    - **Team 20Five** and Colt switched places last week flopping highest/lowest scoring efforts.  His young lineup has quickly been tweaked to include fantasy darling *WRs Nacua and Collins* while QB still remains a long team question mark.  If *QB Jones* can submit efforts like the 2nd half of the Giants/Cards game last week his team should have less varied success. 
    - **GNS** leaned on monster performances by both his winless AFC West *QBS Wilson and Herbert* to outlast Pat in what was one of the best games of last week.  The Chargers could be in for more scoring this week vs the Vikings and the same goes for the Broncos on the road in Miami.  Time will tell if riding these two organizations who are producing solid fantasy output but lacking in reality are stable enough to rely on.

### Glab em by the Pussy(1-1) vs KGuns(0-2)
- Two teams who find themselves at the bottom look up of LPB align for this matchup which according to projections could be one to watch.
    - **Glab em by the Pussy** Could have had a better chance in week 2 if not for both his QBs diarrheaing the tub.  It may not have mattered against the buzz-saw that was *Team 20Five* but he has to be thinking points were left on the table.
    - **KGuns** also appears to be weathering a storm of lousy QB play which is almost always a recipe for languish in LPB.  a *WR Evans* go off was wasted in his week 2 effort as basically no one else really contributed in a notable way.  Another loss week and you have to question the direction of the roster build entirely.. or do you hold fast relying on *QB Burrow* and *WR Chase* to right the ship and turn it around?

### Dead Rabbits(0-2) vs Disease(1-1)
- Two teams that appear to be well balanced on paper lock horns in Week 3.  Falls finds himself right in the thick of the LPB standings while Pat is looking to get himself into the win column for the first time.
    - **Disease** was firing on all cylinders against Colt in week 2.  The game was really never in doubt and must have Falls feeling confident as he moves forward.  Well rounded scoring from all angles was the recipe for sucess and if he is able to recreate that this week with a healthy roster Pat could be in for trouble.
    - For **Dead Rabbits** the situation could quickly become dire.  There's reason for optimism on his roster but falling into an 0-3 hole would almost gaurentee a tough stretch ahead at any shot of a higher seed for LPB playoff positioning.  An NFC matchup between the Cowboys and shit tier Cardinals could likely determine his fate if *QB Prescott* and *WR Lamb* end up sinking or swimming.
