# Week 1
## Team 20Five vs A-A-Rons Team ##
- An interesting matchup pits league newcomer against the three time champion in what should result in a down to the wire contest.
- These teams both offer up a lot of ***Q*** marks early in the season:
    - For **A-A-Ron** its literally on his roster.  This includes his most potent and expensive draft day weapon, the $38 *TE Kelce*.  Along with his 3rd selection *WR Waddle* and two others you have to wonder if his team has enough firepower to make a splash debut in LPB.  Forttunately he does have the reliable Andrews to slot into Kelce's position, opting for a draft day strategy from a page out of Patriots coach Bill Belichek's book.  One wonders if this a winning formula in a league as prestigious as LPB.
    - For **Team 20Five** its not quite as literal, with the questions revolving around who from his roster will step up or step back in Week 1.  Outside of the QB/TE Combo of Jones and Waller he is relying on young talent to fulfill championship expectations.  He may opt to leave *QB Pickett* out of the starting lineup, even after he was the focus of a raucous bidding war on draft night.  His squad will have to pull the right levers this year to conjure up big scoring from week to week.  Whether or not the young Steelers QB will use this as competitve fuel for the upcoming season or potentialy create a rift in the locker rooom remains to be seen.
