# Week 1
## Colt vs GNS
- A classic matchup, one which anyone who follows LPB wouldn't be suprised to see in the post season between two 3 Time Title winners.  This one pits two guys who arguably have the most fantasy knowledge, **Colt** via his workplace, and **GNS** through satellite radio.
      - **Colt** has assembled a well balanced roster of "Colt Guys" including *WR St Brown* *RB Gibbs* and *TE Freiermuth.  His season may ultimately hinge on the health of *QB Tagovailoa* and his potentially explosive connection with *WR Hill*
      - **GNS** is behind in the projections but not out of the picture just yet.  It may take a return to form of *QB Wilson* in week 1 to have a shot at a victory.  He's ended up with two each of Chargers, Jags and Broncos so anyone facing him early in the year can keep an eye on those matchups.

## Disease vs Labbatt Drew Light
- Almost a year removed from a storybook meetup at the Bills/Rams season opener a year go, **Disease** and **Labbatt Drew Light** find themselves once again face to face with a newfound respect for one another.
      - After a lackluster first campaign in LPB, Drew was committed to not having a star QB to build his team around in year two.  He managed to secure *QB Mahomes* with a draft high $70 bid, second only to our lord and savior *QB Allen*.  Drew is certainly hoping that having a franchise cornerstone alters his trajectory this year.  Week 1 features the all or nothing QB tandem of *QB Mahomes* and *QB Howell* ($14).
      - **Disease** hopes to start the infections early, offering a roster that doesn't seem to have any glaring weaknesses beyond maybe an unproven *TE Kincaid*.  Both teams featured here pepper the schedule with a littany of players in primetime slots so this matchup will keep the league on the edge of their seats from Thursday to Monday Night.
  
## CF vs KGuns
- We all know **KGuns** circles the calendar any time that he is matched up opposite of an Arnold and week 1 is no exception.  This tilt features a **CF** squad who stirred up quite a buzz in this years draft as he shot his load twice to secure *QB Hurts* and LPB darling *QB Allen*.  All eyes will be on CF to see if this strategy is sustainable or if he should have kept his proverbial powder dry.
    - **KGuns features a high caliber tandem in *QB Burrow* and *WR Chase* as well as a well balanced offense that could score big points even if *QB Watson* is a bust in Cleveland this year.
    - **CF** Will depend on bargain shopping and a shrewd eye on the Free Agent wire to complement his headline QB act.

## Poopsnake vs Dead Rabbits
- This game pits two longtime friends in a week 1 clash featuring no shortage of subplots.  Yahoo seems to favor the Rabbits in projections but a closer look at the game unveils plenty of intrigue.   I have to think that this game will likely come down to the output of each teams QB+WR combination, adding some drama into this affair which we may have to wait until Monday Night is complete to know the outcome of.
    - For **Poopsnake** owners and fans round the league are wondering where Mike's heart is as he will have to balance his love of the Buffalo Bills against the production of his own *QB Rodgers*, *WR Wilson* and *NY Jets Defense* in week 1.
    - For **DeadRabbits** Pat has parlayed his love of the Cowboys into ownership of *QB Prescott* and *WR Lamb* so there will be no question of where his allegiances lie this upcoming campaign.  A potent offense could materialize this week with *QB Jackson* at home against what looks to be a noncompetitve Texans squad.

## Team 20Five vs A-A-Rons Team ##
- An interesting matchup pits league newcomer against the three time champion in what should result in a down to the wire contest.
- These teams both offer up a lot of ***Q*** marks early in the season:
    - For **A-A-Ron** its literally on his roster.  This includes his most potent and expensive draft day weapon, the $38 *TE Kelce*.  Along with his 3rd selection *WR Waddle* and two others you have to wonder if his team has enough firepower to make a splash debut in LPB.  Fortunately he does have the reliable *TE Andrews* to slot into Kelce's position, opting for a draft day strategy from a page out of Patriots coach Bill Belichek's book.  One wonders if this a winning formula in a league as prestigious as LPB.
    - For **Team 20Five** its not quite as literal, with the questions revolving around who from his roster will step up or step back in Week 1.  Outside of the QB/TE Combo of Jones and Waller he is relying on young talent to fulfill championship expectations.  He may opt to leave *QB Pickett* out of the starting lineup, even after he was the focus of a raucous bidding war on draft night.  His squad will have to pull the right levers this year to conjure up big scoring from week to week.  Whether or not the young Steelers QB will use this as competitve fuel for the upcoming season or potentialy create a rift in the locker rooom remains to be seen.
