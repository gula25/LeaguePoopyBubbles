# Week 7

## Gula's Game of the Week - Colt(4-2) vs cF(4-2)
- A battle near the top of the LPB standings with go off and stay off potential highlights week 7, with many of the big chips falling on a juicy SNF matchup with a ton of fantasy and reality potential interest.  Whoever's QB Collinsworth spends more time giving hand release to could likely reign supreme.
    - **Colt** continues to fire on all gears as he has manages to connect up giant go offs from his Miami players like a Haitian pushing heavy weight.  He simply cannot and will not be stopped on any week where the Dolphins juggernaut offense is playing Madden on rookie difficulty.  This week Miami could again throw up big numbers as the Eagles traditionally well respected defense has not looked too imposing just yet.
    - **cF** seemed to have contracted a chest cold versus Falls in week 6.  Pedestrian performances by his alpha dogs gave him virtually no outs as he only managed to scrounge up a sub 60 point performance on the week.  Certainly there is no cause for concern yet but the potentially flaw of his team building strategy has finally reared its head.  *WR Kirk* respectablly opened his account for the week on TNF, but ultimately everyone around the league knows this will be decided between *QB Allen and Hurts* and *QB Tua and Hill* and the SNF matchup.


### A-Aron's Team (4-2) vs Disease(3-3)
- Who's warrior spirit will carry the day between a Spartan and a Seminole?
    - **A-Aron's Team** has yet to show any signs of being afraid of heights as he still sits comfortably at the top of LPB.  It's hard to imagine any of us saw the newcomer having this much success to start his season, and if we did we would have never extended the invite.  It didn't take much scoring to outlast a sub par performance from GNS in week 6.  Tough matchups at the top of his roster may end up costing him in this match which figures to be pretty tight according to Yahoo projections.  Will he be Johnny on the spot against Jon?
    - **Disease** Finds himself mid table with a .500 record as he travels home to LPB League offices, while having amassed the 2nd most points in the league.  Certain bulletin board material in the fact he has scored 100 more points than his opponent yet finds himself carrying two more losses at this stage may give his team the mental edge it needs to avoid a trap game here after a complete ass beat of cF in week 6.  He may be flying under the radar, this team could be LPB's best chance at a sleeping giant.
  
### Dead Rabbits(2-4) vs KGuns(2-4)
- 7th and 8th place teams collide in a matchup of longtime pals that could end up more of a defensive matchup as both players have their strongest players on bye week with Bengals and Cowboys getting rest.
    - **KGuns** finds himself weathering the storm as the Bengals are on bye this week leaving him without his striped jungle predator duo.  Jake probably never expected to have to be starting *QB Dobbs and Ridder* together when the season started but alas here we are.  
    - **Dead Rabbits** easily held off Team20Five in a wire to wire performance that was really never in doubt last week.  Much like his opponent he finds the lions share of his best options on the bench during a crucial bye week.  If he is able to fit the pieces together this week and inch closer to .500 he could have genuine reason for optimism heading into the 2nd half of the LPB season.

### Team 20Five(2-4) vs Labbatt Drew Light(4-2)
- Two teams with different outlooks on the remainder of the season lock up in week 7.
    - **Team 20Five** is now forced to sleep in the bed he made on draft night.  This may end up a certified nightmare as he finally gives *QB Pickett* the nod as the rest of his QBs have turned into a M.A.S.H. unit.  If *QB Jones* can't go on Sunday, he'll start *QB Bagent* who looks like a guy he should actually be guarding during Wednesday night basketball, not running an NFL offense.  Barring a go off from left field he's almost certainly doomed in week 7, as these these ongoing weekly previews may be all he has to offer the league.
    - **Labbatt Drew Light** travels north to the epicent of LPB league activity.  Much like the Bills traveling to London, this timely trip may be the only possible wrinkle that would shake up his rhythmn heading into what should be a comfortable week 7 win over Gula.  Favorable matchups and no key guys on a bye this week are reflected in the Yahoo predictions as he attempts to keep pace with the LPB leaders.

### Poopsnake(1-5) vs GNS(3-3)
- Two capable handymen with ideal football watching caves tangle after a quick start on TNF.
    - **GNS** may have missed a chance to get above .500 as he fell victim to the A-A-Ron's team curse of not going off opposite him.  He still has to like his chances in this tilt with both of Mike's QBs already in the clubhouse and having a decent *RB Kamara* start.  Now he can settle into the comofort of his man cave and hope to ease through Sunday getting above the even water mark as we head into the back half of the LPB calendar.
    - **Poopsnake** continues to hate life after falling to Drew in week 6.  He's simply been a magnate for opponent go offs this year, consistently struggling to find scoring while his opponents clog his drain with points.  No one likes to have both QBs already spoken for heading into Sunday, but Mike can find solace in a clutch wrinkle to *QB Carr's* night as he just topped the bonus yardage threshold.  Whether or not this lifeline ultimately figures into the outcome of this game remains to be seen.
