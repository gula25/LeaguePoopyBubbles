# Week 6

## Gula's Game of the Week - Disease(2-3) vs cF(4-1)
- Major media markets clash for bragging rights in this juicy week 6 matchup between Falls and Chad.
    - **Disease** has started to make a habit out of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  In week 5, his fate was sealed even before the weekend games kicked off as Jake rode a mammoth *WR Moore* game out to to a commanding lead that he wouldn't relinquish en route to a resounding victory.  That being said his own locker room has been committed and consistently putting up respectable weeks and there is cause for optimism to his fortunes changing as he was able to land a potential prize on the FA market for once in the form of *RB Demercado*.
    - **cF** has reaped the rewards of his all-in approach on top end QB talent so far this season as he relied on his bell cows to bouy otherwise lackluster scoring in his battle of the brothers week 5 matchup.  Although sitting comfortably in first place, his poisition could be more perilous than it seems as his roster beyond QB has been largely anemic.  With Bye weeks around the corner he may need to simply stay healthy and avoid opponent go-offs to remain at the top.


### A-Aron's Team (4-1) vs GNS(3-2)
- LPB competitors old and new battle as A-Aron's team tries to continue the changing of the guard against Dustin.
    - **A-Aron's Team** shrugged off his first LPB Loss with a tight win in an exciting week 5 game, leveraging a massive *RB Etienne* game to glory over his longtime friend Mike.  The RBs output managed to make both Shid in reality and Fard in fantasy as it was crucial in the Jags outcome over the beloved Bills.  Ultimately the win may be looked back on as an *at what cost* game as his *QB Cousins* loses his primary option and his other explosive players *WR Olave and TE Kelce* continue to nurse injuries.
    - **GNS** unfortunately didn't put his best foot forward against his kinsmen in week 5, leading to a disappointing loss.  He too has a couple key players on his roster nursing injuries, and this game figures to be a close contest with potential playoff seeding implications.  This game will likely depend on prime-time performances during TNF (Broncos vs Chiefs) and SNF (Chargers vs Cowboys) which Dustin will certainly analyze from the safety of his well provisioned mancave.
  
### Colt(3-2) vs KGuns(2-3)
- Two teams coming off a win lock horns in this matchup between long time Bills media Producer and Consumer.
    - **KGuns** finally hit all the right shots in his 6-1, 6-1 straight set win against **Disease**.  Monster scoring from the WR and DEF positions, including *QB Burrow and WR Chase* resulted in the most lobsided win of the week.  Although he sits with a sub .500 record currently Jake has to consider his team at a critical inflection point of the LPB campaign.
    - **Colt** held **Team 20Five** hostage with near constant Red Zone channel cuts to *QB Tua and WR Hill* explosive plays.  Colt showed resilience in easily shrugging off an unsuspected *QB Fields* go off and easily pulling away to a convincing win.  With his Miami Vice looking potent and Yahoo considering a Week 6 favorite he may be lulled into sleep against Jake's own tandem which many consider a sleeping giant up until this point in the season.

### Team 20Five(2-3) vs Dead Rabbits(1-4)
- A classic loser leaves town matchup here towards the bottom of the LPB standings.. two Bud Rose disciples tango in an attempt to get an angle.
    - **Team 20Five** has been true to form for his imbalanced boom or bust roster.  Another week, another *QB Richardson* injury early almost assured his defeat, regardless of how off Colt's aquatic mammals were prepared to go.  *QB Fields* was a bright spot, but is not a player who is known for consistency.  This matchup figures to be tight and likely will be in the balance depending on the outcome of Chargers Cowboys on MNF.
    - **Dead Rabbits** remains on life support in 9th place, as an unexpected poor *RB McCaffrey* performance likely cost him the week 5 matchup against Drew.  It was a defensive battle and close throughout, almost anyone going off would have likely sealed the deal but Pat just couldn't find production from his core.  TE and K positionally performances bouyed an otherwise flaccid effort.  The margin for error remains small for Pat as he looks to stay relevant.

### Poopsnake(1-4) vs Labbatt Drew Light(3-2)
- Drew vs Mike.. what more needs to be said.
    - **LDL** finds himself mid table in LPB standings, something he can surely be proud of.  He may be net negative in points for versus against, but he's coming off a two game win streak and may be rounding into form.  Two upcoming matchups featuring his *QB Mahomes and RB Pacheco* Chiefs tandem against the deplorable Bronco's defense are more reason for high expectations for the 2nd year franchise.
    - For **Poopsnake** is living up to the name through 5 weeks of the LPB calendar.  Like a wretched day after garbage plate turd his team has lodged itself in the proverbial LPB standings drain.  Losing a close high scoring game against virgin entrant **A-A-Ron's Team** certainly doesn't help the situation, but all is not yet lost for Mike.  He may not have to wait long to view his potential week 6 fate as much of Drew's scoring is likely dependant on the Chiefs, and if that somehow doesn't unfold the way most pundits expect there is a decent chance Mike finds just the Liquid Plumber he needs.
